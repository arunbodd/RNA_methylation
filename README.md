# RNA_methylation
RNA methylation is less known until late 1970s and it only has increased its significance as NGS enabled RNA-sequencing revealing the transcriptome which is now being used to study various post-transcriptional modifications. One such modifications is m6A, a methyl transferase based modification on 6th nitrogen of Adenosine on the RNA.

Here, the code outputs spearman correlation of all RBPs listed in my file across 31 tissues. This step was essential to check how are methyl transferase enzymes are correlated with other other proteins
